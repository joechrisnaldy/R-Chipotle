Create and explore interactive maps using Leaflet to determine where to open the next Chipotle.

**Introduction** </br>
Chipotle Mexican Grill ($CMG) is a typical Mexican fast-food restaurant founded in 1993 in America. The restaurant was based on the idea that fast-food restaurants do not have to be like other restaurants with similar menus. The name 'Chipotle' comes from the name of the dried, smoked jalapeno peppers. The founder of Chipotle Mexican Grill is an alumnus of the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park named Steve Ells. After graduation, he worked as a cook at Jeremiah Tower at Stars in San Francisco. Armed with lessons and experience, Steve founded his first Chipotle restaurant in Denver, Colorado, on July 13, 1993[9] with his father's $85,000 in the capital. In 2019, Chipotle Mexican Grill had branches of as many as 2,622 restaurants in various regions. With revenues of 5.58 billion USD and is included in the S&P 500 index. </br>
Some of us have thought about opening a business, and most of us have thought about grabbing a burrito from Chipotle. To do either of these things, we need to know where the current Chipotle stores are (and are not) located. We will use data from Thinknum to find potential locations for the next Chipotle restaurant and where we might recommend opening a Chipotle.

**Conclusion** </br>
After we create a county-level choropleth map showing population, drawing circles with a 100-mile radius around each proposed location and mapping Voronoi polygons to estimate the area covered by each proposed Chipotle. We can conclude that if you want to open the Chipotle, we can open it in Rapid City, SD.
